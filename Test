/*/ CONCEPTS USED
 I implement instantiation where i created an object from an existing class in order to get my random to guess. 
I also imported a Scanner class and instantiated that as well in order to enter guesses. 
Using a while loop allowed my program to continually run until the player does not wish to play anymore or until they hit the max times playable in this case 10. 
I then use a "if else" statement in order to tally up the wins and loss the player gets from guessing.

		int x = 0;

				x++;

				random = die.GetValue();

								+ "please guess which number it picked");

					WIN++;
