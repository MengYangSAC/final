/*/ CONCEPTS USED
 I implement instantiation where i created an object from an existing class in order to get my random to guess. 
 I had to create multiple objects where some needed variables so i had to add methods which worked along with my program.
I also imported a Scanner class and instantiated that as well in order to enter guesses and tell the program to get another card.
Using a while loop allowed my program to continually run until the player does not wish to play anymore or until they hit the max times playable in this case 10 or 3. 
I then use a "if else" statement in order to show the user if they had won or lost or tied and put in multiple condition so that the player had to follow the rules.
